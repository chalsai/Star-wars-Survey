# Star-wars-Survey

Course work

Welcome to the Star Wars Survey project!

In this project, you'll work to analyze data on the Star Wars movies. When you're finished, you'll have a notebook you can either add to your portfolio or expand on your own.

Google, StackOverflow, and the documentation for various packages will help you as you progress through this project. Data scientists make extensive use of resources like these as they write code.
